Sprite source files
===================

These don't need to be built or even touched before building the
actual client. The assembler output is already included in the client's
source. If you modify the sprites, you'll need to re-export them and
put them in the client.

The sprites are built with SevenuP, an open source sprite making tool
by Jaime Tejedor Gomez, aka Metalbrain. This program can be
downloaded from http://www.speccy.org/metalbrain . SevenuP is cross
platform, available for Linux, Windows, Mac OSX, BSD etc.
