To test call instruction trapping:

POKE 30000, 205
POKE 30001, 248
POKE 30002, 63
POKE 30003, 201

This is
	org 30000
	call 0x3FF8
	ret

Addr. 30001 should be one of the following:
248 = F8
251 = FB
254 = FE

to add an infinte loop with framebuffer poke:
POKE 30003, 62
POKE 30004, 255
POKE 30005, 50
POKE 30006, 0
POKE 30007, 64
POKE 30008, 195
POKE 30009, 56
POKE 30010, 117
